Shortened the combinational path for signalling full instruction queues at system level. Initially the full buffer signal would be routed to uart-transmitter-bridge then reproduced as
another signal that was then sent to the LED flasher module.

Verified the I2C Uart bridge module. Figured out how to run assert statements and random functions in testbench.

Finished writing the UART transmitter testbench

Fully verified the UART to I2C transmitter module and the I2C to UART transmitter module. 

Tasks left: Verify I2C controller;

- We have 2 cycles necessary for relevant data to appear on SDA line. First part is setup by left shifing on write register. Then passing the most significant bit through
another register before SDA appears on output. Instead we have the relevant SDA bit be either the most significant bit of write register or high impedance and just
route through a multiplexor(remove the intermediary register);
